# THE PLAN
- how to command line 
    - ls
    - cd 
    - pwd
    - mkdir
    - rm 
    - touch
    - cp 
    - mv 
    - man
    - what is sudo
    - nano, gedit, vim, etc (command line text editors)

- do you have installed? 
    - first run `python --version`
    - if no python/ python says not 2.7.xx
    - else run `sudo apt install python2`
    - check for `pip --version`
    - run `sudo apt install python-pip`

- IDLE (Integrated Learing and Devlopment Enviroment)
    - shell where you can run all the python things 
    - launch `python`
    - print statements 
    - import this
    - '_' is last thing
    - exit()
    - Documentation:
      - https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/index.htm

- Notes
    - everything in python is a object 
    - dynamically typed

- Variable stuff
  
    - `x=1`
    
- Strings 
    - immutable, can not change inside after assignment `str[0]=a` go brr
    - string '' or ""
    - multiline """ """ or
    - putting quotes in strings '""' or "''"
    - str() <- attempts to convert what ever you put in this to a string
    - putting strings together with `str1 + str2`
    - individual values with `str[0]`
    - to find length `len(str)` 
    - slicing with `str[0:3]`,`str[:]`,`str[0:-2]`,`str[:4]` 
    
    - many more useful funcl
    
- Lists
    - mutable can change insides after assignments
    - `l = []` or `l = list()`
    - can also add values during creations `l = [1,2,3]`
    - can mix values `l = [1,'hello', []]`
    - access elements with `l[i]`
    - slice with `l[0:3]` all slicing rules from the end apply
    - gets length of list `len(l)`
    - cat lists together with `l1+l2`
    - sort with `l.sort()` keep in mind .sort() occurs in place and does not return anything to return something use `sorted()`, 
    - use `l.sort(key = func, revere = bool)` for example pass in len to sort by the len function
    - many useful func
    
- Tuples 

    - immutable
    - tuples are faster than lists 
    - cant change length or change internals 
    - used when data should not change 
    - make with `t = (1,2,3,4,5)` or `t= tuple(1,2,3,4,5)`

- Dictionaries

    - mutable
- basically a hashmap 
    - uses key:value
- `d = {} `or `d = dict()`
    - `dict = {"one":1, "two":2, "three":3} `
- access a element using `d[key]`
    - can set a element above with `d[key]=value`
- get a list of keys with `d.keys()`
    - get a list of values with `d.values()`
    - get a list of tuples with` d.items()`
    
- Conversion

    - wrapping  an object in either `str(),list(),tuple(),dict(),int(),float()` will attempt to convert that object into that data type 
    - type()


- main.py file 
    - python is interpreted line by and is not complied 
    - Running a script `python main.py`
- Conditionals

    - `if, elif, else`
    - boolean operators
    - `is, and, not, in, ==, >=, <= , != `
    - talk about indentation here
- loops 

    - `range(start,end,step)` 
    - for i in loop
    - for k,v in dict.items()

        - upacking
