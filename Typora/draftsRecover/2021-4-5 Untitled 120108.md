 

WPI has had 6 MQPs work on quadrupeds or their various components. The most notable of which was SmallKat6, a RC servo based, 16 DOF quadruped, was capable of a static walking gait. Mechanical limitations prevented them from achieving their dynamic walking gait. WPI also experimented with hydraulic muscles7 and was able to perform bounding and hopping gaits. Even with all this research, WPI has yet to produce a stable platform easily usable for research. 





WPI's research into quadrupeds began in 2011 with the Sabertooth MQP. This project produced a 300lb that was cable of carrying a 30lb payload. The team was able to simulate a walking gait for their robot. From then there have been 5 other MQP's on quadrupeds. The most notable of these is SmallKat, a RC servo based, 16 DOF quadruped, was capable of a static walking gait. Mechanical limitations in size and motor power prevented them from achieving a dynamic walking gait.  WPI has also experimented some non traditional areas of quadruped design. the HydroDog project used hydraulic muscles to preform bounding and hopping gaits. Low Cost Quadruped while limited in mobility was able to preform slam and facial recognition on the robot. Even with all this research, WPI has yet to produce a stable quadruped platform easily usable for research.
